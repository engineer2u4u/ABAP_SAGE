In early 90’s when Industries were expanding, then there was a need of a system or structure that will centralize business Information i.e. bring all the Industrial information at a single place. As the name suggests Enterprise needs a planning to manage all its resource i.e. Human Resource, Manufacturing Resource, Production Resource, Capital Resource, etc. In Business world, it refers to the systems & software packages used by organizations/industries to manage daily business activities, such as procurement, manufacturing, delivery, accounting, project management and human resource management. Why we need ERP? Let us suppose, we don’t have any ERP system. And I am the owner of Tea shops in China. I am planning to expand my tea shop chains across the globe. Now, I have to make a directory of every employee, every sale, every purchase of raw items, every rented shops and etc. Now, if I want to check data for every place, I have to go there physically and check. If each data is maintained in an Excel sheet, then also I have to check them individually. That is the wastage of my time and money. And we have to save both. Thus, the requirement was there to build something that will bring all the data at a single place and further can be verified and using them Business planning’s can be made.</h1>",

      "content": "<div style='margin:10px;padding:10px' ><h2>Introduction</h2>We have been writing codes in different languages (such as <a href='https://gocoding.org/abap-beginner/'>ABAP</a>, CDS, UI5/FIori and <a href='https://gocoding.org/sap-odata/'>OData</a>) at different platform (SAP NetWeaver, SAP Editor, HANA Studio, and SAP Web IDE) to achieve CRUD operation on business data. These all have their own limitation such as source independent development, platform independent development, etc. To remove dependency on multiple platforms and to combine SAP and open-source tools at a single platform, SAP came with Cloud Application Programming Model. In this article we will explore it in detail.<h2>SAP Cloud Application Programming Model</h2>SAP Cloud Application Programming Model, also known as SAP CAP is a frameworks of tools, languages and libraries (both open source and SAP tools and technologies) designed efficiently with SAP best practices to help developers to minimize coding efforts, develop reusable peace of codes in form of micro services and to focus on designing and implementing business/enterprise specific logic.<h2>Architecture of SAP Cloud Application Programming Model</h2>In this section we will talk about two different architectures. The first one will be the high level architecture provided by SAP. The other one will emphasize more on the flow of development.<img class='alignnone wp-image-1977 size-full' title='SAP Cloud Application Programming Model' src='https://gocoding.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SAP-Cloud-Application-Programming-Model.png' alt='SAP Cloud Application Programming Model' />According to the architecture attached above, we can conclude that in this programming model we will be using:<ol> <li>Web IDE and other development tools such as Visual Studio Code.</li> <li>To model our data we will be using the annotation power of HANA CDS.</li> <li>To write business logic we will be using Service SDKs such as Node.js or Java</li> <li>To deploy our node module, java module, UI5 Module we will have Cloud Foundry as Paas.</li> <li>To save our business data we will be using HANA or other database</li> <li>To develop our user Interface we will be using SAP Fiori and other UI tools</li> <li>The whole tool and framework will be utilizing on SAP Cloud Platform Infrastructure</li></ol>Now to understand the architecture in a better way, we can redesign it as below:<img class='alignnone wp-image-1976 size-full' title='SAP CAP Architecture' src='https://gocoding.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SAP-CAP-Architecture.png' alt='SAP CAP Architecture' width='887' height='597' />In the architecture shown above we have illustrated the flow of development in terms of CAP development.&nbsp;<h2>Technologies and Tools Involved in SAP Cloud Application Programming Model</h2><table><tbody><tr><td width='151'><strong>Tool/Technology</strong></td><td width='142'><strong>Purpose</strong></td><td width='308'><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td width='151'>Hana Data Base</td><td width='142'>Store Business Data</td><td width='308'>This can be any database</td></tr><tr><td width='151'>Core Data Services</td><td width='142'>Model Data Service</td><td width='308'>It mainly uses HANA CDS <a href='https://help.sap.com/viewer/4505d0bdaf4948449b7f7379d24d0f0d/2.0.00/en-US/4a9ce69fa73c42d19dbf010f79e96f67.html'>Artifacts</a></td></tr><tr><td width='151'>Java/ Node.js</td><td width='142'>Add Business logic</td><td width='308'>In place of ABAP, business logic will be written here</td></tr><tr><td width='151'>UI5/Fiori</td><td width='142'>UI Design</td><td width='308'>Like convention Fiori Application, the UI will be developed in same uniform manner</td></tr><tr><td width='151'>SAP Cloud Foundry</td><td width='142'>CAP Deployment</td><td width='308'>The CAP application is deployed in to SAP Cloud Foundry…</div>",
